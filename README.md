Pixy
====

A demonstration of rapid ui prototyping user interfaces. The idea is to provide a QML based list of images with an image viewer. This is done in 3 steps. Each steps shows another layer for user interfaces: structure, surface, content.

Structure
---------

For structure it uses a wireframing concept based on simple QML components and a marker (which is a semi transparent element).

Surface
-------

Adding visual elements to the structure to polish the user interface

* pixy02a - initial code
* pixy02z - final code

Content
-------

Providing real data for the UI simulation (requires the dataprovider repo)
